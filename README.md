This is a restaurant menu app that I developed during my software summer internship. Here is some information about the app:

- Framework: Flutter & Dart
- State Management: RxDart
- HTTP requests: http package
- Handled possible errors during runtime
- Aimed to create an adaptive app
- Utilized model classes to process data from the API
- Emphasized readable code and a well-organized folder structure
- Implemented adaptive height and weight to ensure compatibility with all screen sizes
